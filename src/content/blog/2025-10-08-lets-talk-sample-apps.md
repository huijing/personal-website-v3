I'm back in the Developer Relations profession. But after going through the [migration](/blog/migrating-from-hugo-to-astro) last weekend, it occurred to me that some part of my current job was something that I have been doing over the years I've had this blog. And that is, explaining to others how something is done and how things work.

My only 2 developer relations jobs were at companies that provided SDKs as products to developers (among other things they do to make revenue). And so it was important to show developers how our SDKs were used and what you could do with them. This meant that I needed to know these SDKs really well, especially all the bits that don't work very well.

But today, I wanna talk about sample applications. The keyword here is "sample".

What is the point of a sample application? Well, for my context, I would broadly categorise them into 2 groups:

1. **Learning sample applications**  
   Such applications are meant to guide a developer on how to implement something and hopefully they can apply what they learned into their own applications
2. **Showcase sample applications**  
   Such applications are meant to show what a particular technology makes possible
